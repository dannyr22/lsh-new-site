        “Just like to thank Emma for these most excellent cocktails purchased to
        celebrate our Let’s Stay Home” 10th wedding anniversary. Both are
        excellent, the salted caramel Espresso Martini does blow your socks
        off…Neither are going to last the evening though hic” – Chris “We had a
        cocktail masterclass in the garden – pitched perfectly and loads of fun.
        Cocktails were delicious!“ – Helen “Quick to respond to questions prior
        to order. Hand delivered fresh and cold, ready to drink! Will definitely
        be placing another order and highly recommend.” – Bindu “Phew! Best
        Margarita I’ve had for many many years. Thank you. Your recipe was
        perfect!” – Helen “We really enjoyed the day very much and the cocktails
        went down a storm!!” – Rachel “Thank you so much it was great! Drinks
        were fantastic, everyone was saying how good there were.” - Hayley “What
        an inspired idea to provide us with yummy cocktails and also getting us
        all in the road to talk to our neighbours (at a social distance). Thank
        you for your hard work and for raising so much money for the NHS.” –
        Geof and Denise “I have used Let’s Stay Home a couple of times already,
        what a fabulous idea. The cocktails are superb and so easy to drink. My
        only regret is that we’re four adults in the household and I had to
        share” – Sarah
